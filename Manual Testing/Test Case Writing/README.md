## Introduction

The purpose of this folder is to maintain a comprehensive set of test cases for applications. Proper test cases help in identifying bugs, ensuring the software meets its requirements, and maintaining the quality of the product.

## Folder Structure

The structure of this folder is organized to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the test cases:


- **UnitTests/**: Contains test cases for individual units or components of the software.
- **IntegrationTests/**: Contains test cases for testing the integration between different modules or features.
- **SystemTests/**: Contains test cases for overall system testing, including end-to-end scenarios and performance testing.

## How to Write Test Cases

When writing test cases, please adhere to the following format:

1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
2. **Test Description**: A brief description of what the test case is verifying.
3. **Preconditions**: Any prerequisites that must be met before executing the test.
4. **Test Steps**: A step-by-step list of actions to perform the test.
5. **Expected Results**: The expected outcome of the test.
6. **Actual Results**: The actual outcome after test execution (to be filled after execution).
7. **Pass/Fail**: The result of the test (to be marked after execution).

### Example Format
